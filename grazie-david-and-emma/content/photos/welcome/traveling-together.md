## Traveling 

Photo 1 - Us in Ankor Wat, Cambodia :cambodia: . This was our first international trip together.
<br><br>
Photo 2 - Together on a hike in Zion National Park during the middle of Covid. 
<br><br>
Photo 3 - On a chairlift at Snowbird, Utah. Emma, always willing to try new things, took up skiing after first meeting me because she knew it was one of my great passions in life :sparkling_heart: :skier:. 
<br><br>
Photo 4 - Cool couple shot :sunglasses: ! Our tour guide in Ankor Wat insisted on this photo.
