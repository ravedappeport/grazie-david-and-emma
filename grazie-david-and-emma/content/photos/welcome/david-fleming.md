## Emma's Father

Photo 1 - David and baby Emma building a sandcastle. Emma's nickname has always been "Emma the Duck" because she looked like a little duckling as a baby. :duck::duck::duck:. 
<br><br>
Photo 2 - Emma and her father, David Fleming, at a restaurant in San Diego, California.
<br><br> 
Photo 3 - David was an avid hiker and runner. This is a photo of Emma and David together on a hike in Oregon.
<br><br>
Photo 4 - David used to run up Piestawa Peak in Phoenix Arizona every weekend :mountain:. I took this photo from the summit after making the same run while visiting with Emma's family.
